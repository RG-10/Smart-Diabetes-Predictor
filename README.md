## Abstract

This report documents the development and implementation of the "Smart Diabetes Predictor" project. It predicts an individual's likelihood of having diabetes based on various diagnostic measures. The project uses machine learning techniques and includes an end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment with a user interface.

## Project Specification

The primary objective of this project is to predict the probability of an individual having diabetes using machine learning. The dataset includes medical predictor variables such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, age, and more. The main task is to build an accurate machine learning model for diabetes prediction.
